                                will push you to be a little more active throughout your day.
                                Many people spend their time at home sitting for long periods of time.
                                Whether it be homework, netflix, youtube, or work, it can be detrimental
                                to your health, especially in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/" class="externalLink">recent times of lockdowns.</a></p>

                                            Nearly everyone comes to a point in their life (early or late and often
                                            during mid-age) where they realize they suffer from one or more chronic
                                            challenges that are the result of injury, illness, stress, emotional distress, and/or
                                            less-than-optimal attitudes, belief systems or habitual behaviors. A preponderance
                                            of evidence shows that siting too much contributes significantly to disease, and is a
                                            cofactor in workplace injury. In a meta-analysis of 47 articles (selected from nearly
                                            21,000 studies related to the topic), Biswas (2015) found that there is a significant
                                            correlation between prolonged sedentary behavior and comorbidity factors for
                                            cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, and several other
                                            disabling conditions. There is compelling evidence that sitting less than an hour at a time
                                            and fewer than four hours throughout the work-day significantly decreases associated
                                            comorbidity factors. Additionally, by simply standing and changing posture while
                                            working at a desk, one can increase caloric burn by up to 2Kcal/min through
                                            Non‚ÄêExercise Activity Thermogenesis (Levine, 2004). Biswas (2015) concluded that
                                            additional evidence shows that exercising after work will not significantly reverse the
                                            damage caused by sitting too much throughout the day. But there is good news, the
                                            simple act of standing up and moving around within the workspace for a few minutes
                                            every half-hour to hour can minify many of the harmful effects of sitting (Buckly,
                                            2015).TERM PAPER stuff

                                            <b>Solution</b>: GUM! is a comprehensive set of scientifically proven movements,
                                            meditations and attitudes taken from the best practices in Taoist (ancient
                                            Chinese) Taiji and Qigong tradition, modern physical therapy, Yoga, and other
                                            Eastern and Western methodologies. This solution is delivered through a mostly
                                            fixed set of movements, exercises and meditations (forms) that the student at
                                            first follows along with and ultimately masters. The explanations given while
                                            practicing help students relate the movements to physical, emotional and/or
                                            psychological or emotional challenges they may encounter throughout life.

                                            GUM! involves exercise, meditation, and lifestyle modifications developed to
                                            help people move more, more regularly, and in more beneficial ways. Traditional
                                            Chinese martial arts and healing exercises are the foundation of the program. These
                                            ancient Taoist practice from China helps improve the flow of life force energy (Qi), and
                                            thus offers greater health and longevity to the practitioner. In Western terms, practicing
                                            this gentle repetitive movement helps improve circulation, balance, mobility, and
                                            strength, while reducing stress, fatigue, and stagnation. Qigong activities are a healing
                                            practice that can be traced back over 5,000 years in ancient Chinese culture. In modern
                                            times, studies done in both the East and the West show that multiple categories of
                                            benefits are derived by practicing this art. Some of the categories of benefits studied are:
                                            bone density, cardiopulmonary effects, physical function, balance, fall prevention and
                                            related risk factors, quality of life, self-efficacy, patient reported outcomes, psychological
                                            symptoms, and immune- and inflammation-related responses (Jahnke, et al.,

                                            Labor Statistics, people most at risk for sitting too much are in jobs such as software
                                            developers, bus drivers, long-haul truck drivers, accountants, lawyers, engineers, and
