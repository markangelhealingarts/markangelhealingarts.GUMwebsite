        <p>	“Sitting is the new smoking,” a quote attributed Dr. James Levine of the Mayo Clinic, is now a popular catchphrase. In his 2014 interview with the L.A. Times, he went on to say: "Sitting is more dangerous than smoking, kills more people than HIV and is more treacherous than parachuting. We are sitting ourselves to death" (Macvean, 2014). Although determining which is worse has been debated, the comparison to smoking is apt because like smoking, people first choose to sit excessively, and then it becomes a life-long habit. Also like smoking, no matter how much exercise you do before or after long stints of sitting, it won’t reverse all the damage done by hours of sitting every day. One might also say that sedentary behavior, like smoking, can be addictive since the more you sit, the harder it is to quit.</p>
